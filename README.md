# Runninglog
This is a Sinatra app for logging your running or cycling workouts over time. Runninglog is a CRUD  web app (create, read, update, delete) with user accounts.

# Installation
To install and run Runninlog on your computer, clone this repository and cd into the Runninglog directory through your terminal. Once you're in the right directory, run bundle install to install the gems needed for this app to function on your machine. Be sure to also run 'rake db:migrate' to create the necessary users and workouts tables. When you are ready, type 'shotgun' into the terminal to deploy a local server on your machine for testing and using the app. (Runninglog should accept incoming requests on port 9393 of your network, so navigate to 'localhost:9393' in your browser of choice to work with the app.)
